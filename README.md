## CareMoreBot by Foster Song

CareMoreBot is a Twitter bot that corrects users when they say "I could care less", instead of the correct "I couldn't care less".

##### Learned:
How to work with the Twitter API
Using Twitter live streaming rather than REST API

##### What didn't work:
Had some difficulty extracting proper information from returned Twitter JSONs (they're really long!)
Some error handling issues
Very primitive-- should add more handling of surrounding context
